# Changelog

## Upcoming

- refactor: support `PageWidget` and `Callable[[], PageWidget]` for the `application` field of `ApplicationItem`

## Version 0.13.16

- refactor: make menu transition logic more error-prone in case a transition completion callback call is missed

## Version 0.13.14

- fix: add `mainthread_if_needed` decorator to the remaining subscription handler and item selectors

## Version 0.13.13

- refactor: replace all `kivy.clock.mainthread` decorators with in-house `mainthread_if_needed` which checks the current thread and applies `mainthread` only if not already in the main thread, this is to fix the weird render delay introduced by chain of unnecessary scheduled `mainthread`s

## Version 0.13.12

- refactor: use `kivy.clock.mainthread` wherever needed instead of blindly wrapping all subscriptions of `process_subscribable_value`

## Version 0.13.11

- refactor: wrap subscriptions done by `process_subscribable_value` in `kivy.clock.mainthread` as they may be coming from other threads

## Version 0.13.10

- fix: closing an application now works even if the application is not the root of its hierarchy

## Version 0.13.9

- refactor: set parent of `StackApplicationItem`s like `StackMenuItem`s

- refactor: set key of menu items returned by the action of `ActionItem` if the `ActionItem` itself has a key

## Version 0.13.6

- fix: add `SpinnerWidget` to kivy factory

## Version 0.13.5

- refactor: use `SpinnerWidget` in place of `Label` for all dynamic contents labels, setting its `text` to `` will spin it, otherwise it behaves like a `Label`

## Version 0.13.4

- chore: migrate from poetry to uv for the sake of improving performance and dealing with conflicting sub-dependencies
- feat: add spinner widget which doesn't trigger whole screen renders and uses new local renders of headless-kivy

## Version 0.12.5

- fix: `go_home` should clear the selection of root before setting `stack`

## Version 0.12.4

- fix: going home from home caused a bad state
